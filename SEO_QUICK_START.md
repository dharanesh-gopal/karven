## 💡 Pro Tips

### 1. Write for Humans, Not Robots
❌ "drone services drone company drone solutions drone drone"  
✅ "We provide professional drone services for surveying and mapping"

### 2. Each Page Should Be Unique
Don't copy-paste SEO fields between pages. Google penalizes duplicates.

### 3. Keep It Real
Don't promise what you don't deliver. If your title says "Best", be prepared to prove it.

### 4. Update Regularly
Add new blog posts, update service descriptions, keep content fresh.

### 5. Track Your Progress
- Sign up for Google Search Console (free)
- See what keywords people use to find you
